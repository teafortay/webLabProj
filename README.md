# How to play MIopoly:

1. log in, this creates a new player in the database.
Players can roll dice only once per turn
Players take turns moving aound board
This is a mulipayer game.
When you land on a space that you can buy, You have the option to buy it. The "Buy" button always shows up but the backend wont let you buy GO.
Chance and Community chest are not implemented, think of these spaces like free parking.
2. Buy a property and now you are the owner in the database.
Defaults to 1 booth. You cannot buy more booths, yet.
3. Stay logged in! The turn order doesn't care if you're logged out, for now. So if its your turn, the game halts until you move- working on fixing this!
